        Today is September 2, 2022 this week we learned about the branches of engineering.
        We began using tinkercad to start our project on the rude goldberg machine.
        I lost the challenge day today my wok was not able to compete.

        Today is September 16, 2022 this week we started making our Rube Goldberg machines. 
        We decided to use Justin's model as his was the easiest to build as it required the least
        amount of cardboard to use. For the challenge day we had to make boats float for 5 minutes
        with weight, we used my boat and it survived!!!

        Today is September 23, 2022 this week we did map testing. We also finished up our Rube 
        Goldberg machine on wednesday. Today we were the first group to successfully pop our balloon
        using our Rube Goldberg machine, I recorded the video. Our machine made the baseball roll
        down two ramps to hit a hammer mechanism with a needle and two razor blades at the end to pop the balloon. In the beginning
        the ball kept missing the hammer and rolling off on the left of the ramp to counter this 
        we added a funnel to keep the ball center so that it could hit the hammer. After this addition we successfully
        popped the balloon.
