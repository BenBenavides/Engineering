        Today is August 24,2022 just created my website
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is September 2, 2022 this week we learned about the branches of engineering.
        We began using tinkercad to start our project on the rude goldberg machine.
        I lost the challenge day today my wok was not able to compete.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is September 16, 2022 this week we started making our Rube Goldberg machines. 
        We decided to use Justin's model as his was the easiest to build as it required the least
        amount of cardboard to use. For the challenge day we had to make boats float for 5 minutes
        with weight, we used my boat and it survived!!!
    </p>

        Today is September 23, 2022 this week we did map testing. We also finished up our Rube 
        Goldberg machine on wednesday. Today we were the first group to successfully pop our balloon
        using our Rube Goldberg machine, I recorded the video. Our machine made the baseball roll
        down two ramps to hit a hammer mechanism with a needle and two razor blades at the end to pop the balloon. In the beginning
        the ball kept missing the hammer and rolling off on the left of the ramp to counter this 
        we added a funnel to keep the ball center so that it could hit the hammer. After this addition we successfully
        popped the balloon.

        Today is September 30,2022 this week we did computer dissections. We learned the different parts 
        of a computer, the people in my group was Julian and Hayk. They did most of the dissection, I just
        helped point out different parts of the computer. We did a coloring worksheet about the insides of
        a computer. At the end we put the computer back together for another class to use them.

        Today is October 7, 2022 this week we learned about bioengineering and the various jobs
        that require some bioengineering knowledge. On Wednesday we made tinkercads about animal
        proshetics as it relates to bioengineering. I made a crocodile without a tail and made a tail
        prosthetic for it. Today was challenge day and we had to give instructions on how to make a 
        peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My instructions were chosen for demonstration and it successfully
        made a sandwich. The objective of the challenge was to teach us to be specific with our words.

        Today is October 14, 2022 this week we learned about aeronautical engineering and the various
        requirements needed to get a job in this field. This week we also started cadding and listing 
        materials needed for our bottle rocket project that we will start next week. The materials our 
        group decided we needed for our rocket is 2 2-liter soda bottles, ductape, string, a trashbag, a 
        bike pump, and water. The water and bike pump will be used to create thrust for our rocket. The 
        challenge day we did on thursday was to create a paper object to hit a bucket from the second floor
        of the 1000 building to the platform in front of the ROTC room. I made a paper airplane and failed 
        to hit the bucket.

    <p>
        Today is October 21, 2022, this week we finished up our bottle rockets and launched them.
        Our rocket's main body was made of two 2-liter soda bottles. We used a 3 fin design for our 
        rocket with the fins being made of cardboard and secured to the bottle using duct tape. We 
        also included a parachute portion to slow down the bottles descent by using the second bottle 
        as a place to hold the parachute and open on descent. For the nose of our bottle we just used 
        the bottle cap to create the nose. I was absent on launch day but my teammate told me that our
        bottle was unable to launch due to leaks when the water was added to create thrust for our bottle.

        Today is October 27, 2022 this week we learned about environemental engineering and it's 
        career paths as well as requirements. Today we made a water filter using a 2 liter-soda bottle, 
        big rocks, small rocks, sand, and cotton balls. We made the water filter by cutting the bottle 
        and placing the cap side into the other half of the bottle. To make the actual filter we placed 
        a cotton ball into the cap then we placed sand on top then the small rocks then the big rocks. After
        about 30 minutes most of the water was filtered pretty well, it was clear but there was still a little 
        dirt. After we made the water filter we had a challenge day which was to figure out how many
        candy corns fit on to an 8.5x11 paper using only 10 candy corns.We used an area formula to find our 
        answer which was 216 candy corns on the paper.

        Today is November 4, 2022 this week we learned about electrical engineering and it's career paths.
        We did a worksheet on how to figure out volts, resistance, and circuit needed for a problem. I was
        absent on thursday, but today I finished up on a lab they started on how to make 3 LEDs light up 
        together on tinkercad.

        Today is November 10, 2022 this week we created our tinkercad lab of lighting up 3 leds in 
        real life. We had to use an ardueno instead of a battery for our power source. We also used 
        a multimeter to measure the resistance of our resistors and how many volts were traveling to the 
        leds. We were given a worksheet to complete as we did the lab and I was able to complete it with time 
        left. Today was challenge day only which was a would you rather, the would you rather was to take an 
        entire math course or write 1 - 1,000,000. We calculated the hours of each which was 150 hours for the 
        math class and 818 hours to write to 1,000,000. We calculated the 1,000,000 time by averaging out 
        the time to write a digit at 0.5 seconds and multiplying this number by amount of digits that were 
        needed to write a number. Using this method we found out it would take 2,944,488 second to write to 
        1,000,000.

        Todays is November 18, 2022 today we continued our electrical engineering unit. On tuesday I was 
        absent but the class did a lab on LEDs and arduino's. Today we did a challenge day to gather information and 
        evidence on whether there were more doors or wheels on campus. I was on team wheels and observed
        that every rolling chair had 5 wheels. Team wheels "won" mainly due to Dr.Neats room having about 
        1200 wheels.

        Today is December 2, 2022 this week we learned about civil engineerinh and watched some of 
        the World Cup. Today we started building our spaghetti bridge. We used Julian's sketch and 
        Cad as our model for the bridge. We are only allowed to use 20 pieces of spaghetti to 
        create a bridge that is 24 inches long. We are being judged on the efficiency of our bridge
        to do this we divide the weight of the bridge by the weight of the load it can withstand. 
        We are being judged this way to prevent teams from overusing glue to create a super strong 
        bridge. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is Decmber 9, 2022 this week we continued making iterations of our spaghetti bridge.
        The bridge we made was slightly different from our first one as it was slightly longer. We 
        also planned to make two vertical portions of the bridge instead of one big vertical portion.
        Our bridge was too flimsy and frail as it broke before we could add the vertical portion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is December 16, 2022 this week we started from scratch another bridge. This version of 
        our bridge will be more like our first bridge. Howver we will have more support on the left side
        of the bridge, as that was where it broke last time.
