        Today is August 24,2022 just created my website

        Today is September 2, 2022 this week we learned about the branches of engineering.
        We began using tinkercad to start our project on the rude goldberg machine.
        I lost the challenge day today my wok was not able to compete.

        Today is September 16, 2022 this week we started making our Rube Goldberg machines. 
        We decided to use Justin's model as his was the easiest to build as it required the least
        amount of cardboard to use. For the challenge day we had to make boats float for 5 minutes
        with weight, we used my boat and it survived!!!

        Today is September 23, 2022 this week we did map testing. We also finished up our Rube 
        Goldberg machine on wednesday. Today we were the first group to successfully pop our balloon
        using our Rube Goldberg machine, I recorded the video. Our machine made the baseball roll
        down two ramps to hit a hammer mechanism with a needle and two razor blades at the end to pop the balloon. In the beginning
        the ball kept missing the hammer and rolling off on the left of the ramp to counter this 
        we added a funnel to keep the ball center so that it could hit the hammer. After this addition we successfully
        popped the balloon.

        Today is September 30,2022 this week we did computer dissections. We learned the different parts 
        of a computer, the people in my group was Julian and Hayk. They did most of the dissection, I just
        helped point out different parts of the computer. We did a coloring worksheet about the insides of
        a computer. At the end we put the computer back together for another class to use them.

        Today is October 7, 2022 this week we learned about bioengineering and the various jobs
        that require some bioengineering knowledge. On Wednesday we made tinkercads about animal
        proshetics as it relates to bioengineering. I made a crocodile without a tail and made a tail
        prosthetic for it. Today was challenge day and we had to give instructions on how to make a 
        peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My instructions were chosen for demonstration and it successfully
        made a sandwich. The objective of the challenge was to teach us to be specific with our words.
