        Today is September 2, 2022 this week we learned about the branches of engineering.
        We began using tinkercad to start our project on the rude goldberg machine.
        I lost the challenge day today my wok was not able to compete.

        Today is September 16, 2022 this week we started making our Rube Goldberg machines. 
        We decided to use Justin's model as his was the easiest to build as it required the least
        amount of cardboard to use. For the challenge day we had to make boats float for 5 minutes
        with weight, we used my boat and it survived!!!
