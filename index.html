        Today is August 24,2022 just created my website
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is September 2, 2022 this week we learned about the branches of engineering.
        We began using tinkercad to start our project on the rude goldberg machine.
        I lost the challenge day today my wok was not able to compete.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is September 16, 2022 this week we started making our Rube Goldberg machines. 
        We decided to use Justin's model as his was the easiest to build as it required the least
        amount of cardboard to use. For the challenge day we had to make boats float for 5 minutes
        with weight, we used my boat and it survived!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is September 23, 2022 this week we did map testing. We also finished up our Rube 
        Goldberg machine on wednesday. Today we were the first group to successfully pop our balloon
        using our Rube Goldberg machine, I recorded the video. Our machine made the baseball roll
        down two ramps to hit a hammer mechanism with a needle and two razor blades at the end to pop the balloon. In the beginning
        the ball kept missing the hammer and rolling off on the left of the ramp to counter this 
        we added a funnel to keep the ball center so that it could hit the hammer. After this addition we successfully
        popped the balloon.

        Today is September 30,2022 this week we did computer dissections. We learned the different parts 
        of a computer, the people in my group was Julian and Hayk. They did most of the dissection, I just
        helped point out different parts of the computer. We did a coloring worksheet about the insides of
        a computer. At the end we put the computer back together for another class to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is October 7, 2022 this week we learned about bioengineering and the various jobs
        that require some bioengineering knowledge. On Wednesday we made tinkercads about animal
        proshetics as it relates to bioengineering. I made a crocodile without a tail and made a tail
        prosthetic for it. Today was challenge day and we had to give instructions on how to make a 
        peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My instructions were chosen for demonstration and it successfully
        made a sandwich. The objective of the challenge was to teach us to be specific with our words.

        Today is October 14, 2022 this week we learned about aeronautical engineering and the various
        requirements needed to get a job in this field. This week we also started cadding and listing 
        materials needed for our bottle rocket project that we will start next week. The materials our 
        group decided we needed for our rocket is 2 2-liter soda bottles, ductape, string, a trashbag, a 
        bike pump, and water. The water and bike pump will be used to create thrust for our rocket. The 
        challenge day we did on thursday was to create a paper object to hit a bucket from the second floor
        of the 1000 building to the platform in front of the ROTC room. I made a paper airplane and failed 
        to hit the bucket. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is October 21, 2022, this week we finished up our bottle rockets and launched them.
        Our rocket's main body was made of two 2-liter soda bottles. We used a 3 fin design for our 
        rocket with the fins being made of cardboard and secured to the bottle using duct tape. We 
        also included a parachute portion to slow down the bottles descent by using the second bottle 
        as a place to hold the parachute and open on descent. For the nose of our bottle we just used 
        the bottle cap to create the nose. I was absent on launch day but my teammate told me that our
        bottle was unable to launch due to leaks when the water was added to create thrust for our bottle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is October 27, 2022 this week we learned about environemental engineering and it's 
        career paths as well as requirements. Today we made a water filter using a 2 liter-soda bottle, 
        big rocks, small rocks, sand, and cotton balls. We made the water filter by cutting the bottle 
        and placing the cap side into the other half of the bottle. To make the actual filter we placed 
        a cotton ball into the cap then we placed sand on top then the small rocks then the big rocks. After
        about 30 minutes most of the water was filtered pretty well, it was clear but there was still a little 
        dirt. After we made the water filter we had a challenge day which was to figure out how many
        candy corns fit on to an 8.5x11 paper using only 10 candy corns.We used an area formula to find our 
        answer which was 216 candy corns on the paper.

        Today is November 4, 2022 this week we learned about electrical engineering and it's career paths.
        We did a worksheet on how to figure out volts, resistance, and circuit needed for a problem. I was
        absent on thursday, but today I finished up on a lab they started on how to make 3 LEDs light up 
        together on tinkercad.

        Today is November 10, 2022 this week we created our tinkercad lab of lighting up 3 leds in 
        real life. We had to use an ardueno instead of a battery for our power source. We also used 
        a multimeter to measure the resistance of our resistors and how many volts were traveling to the 
        leds. We were given a worksheet to complete as we did the lab and I was able to complete it with time 
        left. Today was challenge day only which was a would you rather, the would you rather was to take an 
        entire math course or write 1 - 1,000,000. We calculated the hours of each which was 150 hours for the 
        math class and 818 hours to write to 1,000,000. We calculated the 1,000,000 time by averaging out 
        the time to write a digit at 0.5 seconds and multiplying this number by amount of digits that were 
        needed to write a number. Using this method we found out it would take 2,944,488 second to write to 
        1,000,000.

        Todays is November 18, 2022 today we continued our electrical engineering unit. On tuesday I was 
        absent but the class did a lab on LEDs and arduino's. Today we did a challenge day to gather information and 
        evidence on whether there were more doors or wheels on campus. I was on team wheels and observed
        that every rolling chair had 5 wheels. Team wheels "won" mainly due to Dr.Neats room having about 
        1200 wheels.

        Today is December 2, 2022 this week we learned about civil engineerinh and watched some of 
        the World Cup. Today we started building our spaghetti bridge. We used Julian's sketch and 
        Cad as our model for the bridge. We are only allowed to use 20 pieces of spaghetti to 
        create a bridge that is 24 inches long. We are being judged on the efficiency of our bridge
        to do this we divide the weight of the bridge by the weight of the load it can withstand. 
        We are being judged this way to prevent teams from overusing glue to create a super strong 
        bridge. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is Decmber 9, 2022 this week we continued making iterations of our spaghetti bridge.
        The bridge we made was slightly different from our first one as it was slightly longer. We 
        also planned to make two vertical portions of the bridge instead of one big vertical portion.
        Our bridge was too flimsy and frail as it broke before we could add the vertical portion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is December 16, 2022 this week we started from scratch another bridge. This version of 
        our bridge will be more like our first bridge. Howver we will have more support on the left side
        of the bridge, as that was where it broke last time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tpday is December 20, 2022 this week is finals week. The final for this class is the spaghetti 
        bridge. Our bridge was scored by dividind the weight of the water by the weight of our bridge. 
        This was done so teams wouldn't abuse the system by putting on a lot of glue. Our bridge was able
        to hold a cup of water held in a bucket. This was the same as our first iteration. I believed this 
        happen because we focused too much material on the sides and not the middle where the water was being
        held. Our final bridge had a triangular shape to the top as we saw other gorups succeed with a similar
        model.

        Today is January 13, 2023 this our first week back from winter break. This week we really didn't 
        do too much we just learned about business engineering and its branches. The challenge for this week
        was to create a pitch and pitch the idea to the class. Our pitch was an app called ResoMate.
        The app connected people with similar music to share their music and artists to listen to. Our
        app had its flaws but it was good.

        Today is January 20, 2023 today was a challenge day. For our challenge we made oobleck. Oobleck
        is a non-newtonian fluid which means its solid under force but acts like a liquid normally. At first 
        our oobleck was too wet so we added more powder to thicken it. It worked and we made oobleck we also 
        added yellow and blue food coloring to make it green.

        Today is January 27, 2023 this week we start our class project for the next couple of weeks. 
        There were 3 choices on what we could do they were a mouse trap, campus project, or an arduino
        car. Our group of 3 chose to do the arduino car since one of our members is well versed in code.
        This week we just made a report on what we are doing, our biographies, and the cost of all materials.
        After we did this we shared the link to our doc with Mr.Kim.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is February 3, 2023 this week we continued our group project. This week we did tinkercad 
        to model what we are going to make. This tinkercad took us around 2 days of class to do. For today
        our challenge was to create freeways in the most efficent way possible. This was a class challenge 
        so the highest scores for each part of the grid were written down on the board. Our group did not get 
        any scores on the board and we started messing around with the mechanics halfway through.

        Today is February 10, 2023 this we we continued our group project. This week we got our materials
        and started modeling how our car would look. We are going for a box car type design to prevent 
        the arduino from falling out. We also measured and estimated the size of the base of our car,
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is February 17, 2023 this we continued our group project. This week we started assembling 
        our car. For out wheels we got one pair of motorized wheels and discs. For our car the motorized wheels 
        will be positioned in the front of our car so that it can change direction. For our disc wheels we 
        combined two together for more stability. We also used 4 straws taped together as our axel for the discs
        wheels. We also learned how to solder today. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Today is February 24, 2023 and our arduino car is almost complete. This week we put everything 
        that we had together. We had to change the size of the base of our car since the breadboard was
        larger than expected. We also used popsicle sticks to helpm keep the motorized wheels straight
        and prevent them from turning in towards the car. The only things we are missing is the sensor,
        battery, and to solder the wires to our motorized wheels. 
    </p>

        Today is March 7, 2023, today's journal will have this week and last week for it's contents.
        Last week we finished up our arduino car, we were unable to make our bluetooth work so we just 
        removed it and made sure our car went straight instead. To make sure our car ran straight we 
        just ran it multiple times and made mini adjustments to the wheel depending on how the car moved.
        On the way to the cafeteria where everybody would run their car's we realized that our wheels moved
        way slower than other groups cars. But we we could no longer make adjustments. When we ran our 
        car it went straight but it was very slow.
